SlidePadBasic iOS app (part of pd-for-ios, example apps for libpd in iOS)
Nov 21, 2011

This is a simpler, monophonic version of the SlidePad sample that demonstrates the
basics of real-time synthesis with touches.  The main interface resembles
a midi keyboard layout and you run your finger across it to change the 
pitch and magnitude.  There is also a cpu load label, which exemplifies
how to register and recieve data from pd (the patch for calculating the
load is taken from pd's 'Load Meter').
